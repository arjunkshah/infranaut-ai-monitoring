## Conclusion

The current 4-phase structure can accommodate all 8 checklist areas through enhancement rather than expansion. This approach allows for:

1. **Faster time to market** with core features
2. **Iterative development** with continuous improvement
3. **Flexible architecture** that can grow with needs
4. **Resource efficiency** by building incrementally

The recommended approach is to **enhance the existing 4 phases** rather than expanding to 8 phases, as this provides better focus and faster delivery of value to users.
